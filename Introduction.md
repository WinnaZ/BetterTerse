You are reading this in the text pane of the Terse Guide window. This pane is a kind of Workspace and is managed by the SmalltalkEditor of Cuis. This means that you can Do (Cmd-d) or Print (Cmd-p) statements in order to see the result. If you have a Transcript open, the result will appear in it.

The SmalltalkEditor enables you to Do or Print a statement when the cursor is in the statement. It is not necessary to first highlight the entire statement, unless it continues on more than one line.

This text pane is refreshed each time it is accessed. You can change the examples and run them without hurting anything. Go ahead and experiment!

The Terse Guide does not attempt to provide the entire protocol of a topic. You are encouraged to explore further by using the Protocol Browser as follows:

Button 1>World>Open...>Browser 
then in the upper right pane:
Button 2>Message List>browse protocol

You can narrow the scope of protocol browsing by selecting a class in the upper left pane of the Protocol Browser.
